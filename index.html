        <p>We specialize in providing training on the hottest JavaScript technologies being used today. We go deeper than just learning the APIs, we dive into the depths of the technologies to understand how they really work, and explore the best, real-world practices using those technologies. Our trainings are not cookie cutter classes of boring slide decks and lab manuals. Everything we do is live and dynamic, giving students relevant, practical and challenging coding exercises where they code applications under real-world conditions. We do group code reviews, group debugging sessions and many of our classes feature group projects and presentations. Our goal is to prepare students to be successful software developers. This is not just another feel good experience where students walk away with a smile, empty pockets and they still cannot write code.
